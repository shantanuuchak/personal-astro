I obtained a master's degree in psychology at the Faculty of Psychology of UKW with the highest GPA. For four years I was the prefect of the year and have been receiving a scholarship for scientific achievements. I was also a member, president and vice-president of many scientific clubs, and for a short period, I represented the Student Council.
