As a laureate of the EEA grant, sponsored by Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, I participated in a student exchange at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences at the Inland School of Business and Social Sciences, where I studied psychology in English for 6 months. During my stay in Norway, I learned a lot about Scandinavian culture and philosophy.
