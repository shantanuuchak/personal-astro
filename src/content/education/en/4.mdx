I obtained professional qualifications by completing a 4-year Electronic Technical School at the Zespół Szkół Elektronicznych im. Wojska Polskiego in Bydgoszcz in a class focused on mathematics and information technology. I graduated with the highest GPA in the class and a score of 98% in the computer science advanced-level exam.
